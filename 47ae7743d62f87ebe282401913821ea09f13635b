      "message": "Latest patchset fixes this for subsequent packages like com.aurora.store (see commit message). The command from your comment is to check whether F-Droid Basic is set as its own installer, which it can\u0027t be on the first go around, since it needs to be installed already for this to work.\n\nIf we need F-Droid Basic to be its own installer, we can either install it twice -- a bit annoying, but it\u0027s not like it would take very long -- or we may need to make a separate call to set the installer *afterwards*, but that may be where we run into permission / signature issues.\n\n(If you Skip through Lupin, and then reboot right after F-Droid Basic is installed, and go through or skip Lupin again, F-Droid Basic will be set as its own installer when it\u0027s installed the second time.)",
